I'm an environmental scientist with a background in coastal marine science. This site serves as my personal research homepage. 

My research interests lie in three key areas:

1. The application of computational methods to the visualization and analysis of coastal water quality data

2. Wetland restoration and water resources management with a key focus on evaluating ecological thresholds (ecosystem tipping points)

I am an advocate of *Open Science* and reproducible research.
