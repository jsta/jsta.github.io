Over the last year or so, my wife and I have been moving most our files onto Google Drive.  This has worked great as we have access across all of our devices.  The last vestiges of local storage have been our photos.  With the recent purchase of a Chromebook (which I've been impressed with but that is a different post...) and the 1TB of Google Drive storage that came with it, I decided to take the plunge and get our photos up their too.  

Now, I thought that getting the photos moved and organized would be a snap because there certainly had to be a solution for keeping photos on Drive and organized.  There were many options but none of them perfect.  Many of them relied on Google+ Photos (I am not a fan of Google+), struggled with organizing large numbers of photos (nearly 20k), or were not able to be automated.
