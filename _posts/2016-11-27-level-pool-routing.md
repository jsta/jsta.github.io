title: "Level Pool Routing on Reservoir Hydrographs"
output: html_document

---

Level pool routing refers to one of the more straight-forward methods for calculating reservoir outflow given an input hydrograph (time vs inflow) along with information about basin discharge relative to elevation. Here the term *reservoir* is used in the technical engineering context and does not exclude the use of this method for natural lakes. I believe this method is applicable to any waterbody where you can assume a one-to-one relationship between discharge and elevation. Said another way, we assume that discharge does not have a hysteresis component and does not depend on the direction (rising vs falling limb) of the input hydrograph.

For more a more rigorous mathematical treatment of this method see [here](http://www.engr.colostate.edu/~ramirez/ce_old/classes/cive322-Ramirez/CE322_Web/Example_LevelPoolRouting.htm), [here](https://www.caee.utexas.edu/prof/maidment/CE374KSpr12/Docs/Hmwk5Soln.pdf), and [here](https://www.caee.utexas.edu/prof/maidment/CE374KSpr13/Visual/HydrologicRouting.pptx). The following demonstration will lay out the computational details and describe code to implement the method on three test datasets from the above links.

Computation
-----------

The level pool routing computation procedure involves:

-   Determining the volume of the reservoir at a range of depths (if not known ahead-of-time) given its area.

-   Developing a relationship between outflow and reservoir-change-in-storage.
  -   The reference examples use the classical approach of linear interpolation. Here I use non-linear generalized additive modelling to more flexibly represent the shape of this relationship.

Then for each time-step we:

-   Calculate the sum of inflows for the current and previous time-steps.

-   Calculate change-in-storage-with-time as a function of outflow during the previous time-step.

-   Using our fitted relationship to calculate outflows for the current time-step as a function of reservoir change-in-storage.

-   Subtracting these outflows from the running reservoir storage term.

### Linear relationship between discharge and change-in-storage

The data for this example comes from this [level-pool routing walkthrough](http://www.engr.colostate.edu/~ramirez/ce_old/classes/cive322-Ramirez/CE322_Web/Example_LevelPoolRouting.htm). We are given an inflow hydrograph in 6 hour increments so we will specify a `delta_t` timestep of `6 * 3600` seconds. The problem statement specifies an intial storage of 0 and an initial outflow of 20. There is no need to specify reservoir area because we are given storage as a function of discharge.

``` r
input_hydro     <- data.frame(
                    time = seq(0, 162, by = 6),
                    inflow = c(0, 50, 130, 250, 350, 540, 735, 1215,
                              1800, 1400, 1050, 900, 740, 620, 510,
                              420, 320, 270, 200, 150, 100, 72, 45,
                              25, 10, 0, 0, 0))
reservoir_char <- data.frame(
                    elevation = c(130:134, 136:139),
                    discharge = c(20, 34, 57, 96, 162, 463, 781,
                              1318, 2226),
                    storage = c(1, 1.69, 2.85, 4.8, 8.12, 23.1,
                              39.1, 65.9, 111))
reservoir_char$storage <- reservoir_char$storage * 1000000
```

``` r
delta_t <- 6 * 3600

res_linear <- level_pool_routing(input_hydro, reservoir_char,
                area = NA, delta_t = delta_t, initial_outflow = 20,
                initial_storage = 0, linear.fit = FALSE)
```

### Curvilinear relationship between discharge and change-in-storage

The data for this example comes from this [level-pool routing walkthrough pdf](https://www.caee.utexas.edu/prof/maidment/CE374KSpr12/Docs/Hmwk5Soln.pdf). I scraped the data tables from the pdf using the [pdftools package](https://github.com/ropensci/pdftools). We are given storage as a function of discharge so we have no need for information on the area of the reservoir. Also, we are given an inflow hydrograph in 2 hour increments so we will specify a `delta_t` timestep of `2 * 3600` seconds. Unlike the previous example, our reservoir has a non-zero initial storage.

``` r
library(pdftools)
txt  <- strsplit(pdf_text(
  "https://www.caee.utexas.edu/prof/maidment/CE374KSpr12/Docs/Hmwk5Soln.pdf"), "\n")[[1]]

parse_table <- function(tbl, tbl_names){
  tbl <- lapply(tbl, function(x) read.table(text = x,
            stringsAsFactors = FALSE))
  tbl <- lapply(tbl, function(x) gsub(",", "", x))
  
  inds <- lapply(tbl,
            function(x) ifelse(max(grep(")", x)) == -Inf,
            1, max(grep(")", x))))
  inds <- lapply(seq_along(tbl),
            function(x) c(1, (inds[[x]] + 1):length(tbl[[x]])))
  
  tbl <- lapply(seq_along(tbl),
          function(x) as.numeric(tbl[[x]][inds[[x]]]))
  tbl <- data.frame(t(do.call("rbind", tbl)))
  tbl <- tbl[2:nrow(tbl),]
  names(tbl) <- tbl_names
  
  tbl
}

tbl1 <- suppressWarnings(rbind(
          parse_table(txt[6:7], tbl_names = c("time", "inflow")),
          data.frame(time = seq(20, 36, by = 2), inflow = 0)))
tbl2 <- suppressWarnings(
          parse_table(txt[9:10], tbl_names = c("storage", "discharge")))
tbl2$storage <- tbl2$storage * 1000000
```

``` r
res_curv <- level_pool_routing(lt = tbl1, qh = tbl2, area = NA,
              delta_t = 7200, initial_outflow = 57,
              initial_storage = 75000000, linear.fit = FALSE)
```

``` r
plot(res_curv$time, res_curv$inflow, xlab = "Time (s)",
  ylab = "Flow (m3/s)")
lines(res_curv$time, res_curv$outflow)
legend("topleft", legend = c("Inflow", "Outflow"), lty = c(NA, 1),
  pch = c(21, NA))
```

### Oscillating relationship between discharge and change-in-storage

The data for this example comes from this [level-pool routing walkthrough ppt](https://www.caee.utexas.edu/prof/maidment/CE374KSpr13/Visual/HydrologicRouting.pptx). Here we are given discharge as a function of reservoir elevation but we are not given the corresponding storage. As a result, we must specify a reservoir area. We are given an inflow hydrograph in 10 minute increments so we will specify a `delta_t` timestep of `10 * 60` seconds. In this case, our reservoir a zero initial storage and initial outflow.

``` r
lt <- data.frame(time = seq(0, 210, by = 10),
         inflow = c(seq(0, 360, by = 60), seq(320, 0, by = -40),
         rep(0, 6)))

qh <- data.frame(elevation = seq(0, 10, by = 0.5),
         discharge = c(0, 3, 8, 17, 30, 43, 60, 78, 97, 117, 137,
         156, 173, 190, 205, 218, 231, 242, 253, 264, 275))
```

``` r
res_osc <- level_pool_routing(lt, qh, area = 43560, delta_t = 600,
            initial_outflow = 0, initial_storage = 0,
            linear.fit = FALSE)
```

![](../public/images/osc%20plotting-1.png)

``` r

plot(res_osc$time, res_osc$inflow, xlab = "Time (s)",
  ylab = "Flow (cfs)")
lines(res_osc$time, res_osc$outflow)
legend("topleft", legend = c("Inflow", "Outflow"), lty = c(NA, 1),
  pch = c(21, NA))
```
