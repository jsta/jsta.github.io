### Education
  **PhD, Fisheries and Wildlife** (in progress) Michigan State University, East Lansing

  - Supervisor: Dr. Pat Soranno
  
  **MS, Marine Science** (2012) University of Texas, Austin

- Thesis: "Freshwater inflows in the Nueces Delta, TX : impacts on porewater salinity and estimation of needs." ([http://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/ETD-UT-2012-05-5549](http://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/ETD-UT-2012-05-5549))
- Supervisor: Dr. Ken Dunton
- Research: used multivariate statistics and time-series analyses to develop indicators of ecological condition for Texas estuaries. Research products were used in a statewide review of water resources management plans. Deployed a variety of novel water quality sensors to investigate surfacewater - groundwater exchange.

  **BSc, Marine Science** (2008) University of Maine, Orono

- Thesis: "Constructing a guide to the Intertidal Algae of Acadia National Park and testing DNA Barcoding" ([http://www.nps.gov/acad/naturescience/upload/FieldGuidetoMarinePlantsAlgae.pdf](http://www.nps.gov/acad/naturescience/upload/FieldGuidetoMarinePlantsAlgae.pdf))
- Supervisor: Dr. Susan Brawley

2012 - Present

### Work Experience
  
2012 - 2016
: Research Scientist, South Florida Water Management District

- Member of a research team focused on ecological restoration of the Florida Everglades with particular emphasis on the extent to which the Everglades watershed influences downstream estuaries. 
- Responsible for translating ecological information and the results of water quality surveys for use in environmental management. 
- Developed geospatial water quality models. Prepared reports and other materials for presentations to decision makers. 
- Responsible for curating massive environmental databases and developing custom GIS visualization and anaylsis tools.
