## Education

###  **PhD, Fisheries and Wildlife** (in progress) Michigan State University, East Lansing

  - Supervisor: Dr. Pat Soranno
  
###  **MS, Marine Science** (2012) University of Texas, Austin

- Thesis: "Freshwater inflows in the Nueces Delta, TX : impacts on porewater salinity and estimation of needs." ([http://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/ETD-UT-2012-05-5549](http://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/ETD-UT-2012-05-5549))
- Supervisor: Dr. Ken Dunton
- Research: used multivariate statistics and time-series analyses to develop indicators of ecological condition for Texas estuaries. Research products were used in a statewide review of water resources management plans. Deployed a variety of novel water quality sensors to investigate surfacewater - groundwater exchange.

###  **BSc, Marine Science** (2008) University of Maine, Orono
