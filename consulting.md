title: GIS and R Consulting
--- 

I have nearly two decades of experience utilizing GIS in environmental and natural science research. During the last 10 years, I have been weaving in the use of R for these same applications.  I have (admitedly limited) availablity to consult for your project.  Examples of the types of services I can provide are:

- Workshops and Tutorials on R and GIS
- Statistical Consulting for Natural Resources and Environmental Science projects
- R development
- Basic Website Development
- Basic Python development

If you are interested in discussing consulting opportunities, please <a href="mailto:jeff.w.hollister@gmail.com">email me.</a>
