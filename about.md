title: About
---
I am a landscape ecologist with expertise in the spatial component of ecology and environmental sciences. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Biology from Baker University, a Master's Degree in Resource Ecology from Duke University, and a Ph. D. in Environmental Science from the University of Rhode Island. Since, May of 2006, I have worked as a Research Ecologist with the US EPA's Atlantic Ecology Division in Narragansett, RI.  My past experience is in applications of geospatial technologies (such as geographic information systems, spatial statistics, and remote sensing) to environmental research and broad scale environmental monitoring, modeling and assessment.  Currently, my research focus is on how nutrients drive risk of cyanobacterial blooms in lakes and ponds.  A unifying theme to my research is using Open Science (Open Access, Open Source, and Open Data) to benefit environmental science.
