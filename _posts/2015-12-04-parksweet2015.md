Here I examine the sea level trend numbers in **Figure 4** and **Table 3** of:

> Park, J., & Sweet, W. (2015). Accelerated sea level rise and Florida Current transport. _Ocean Science Discussions_, 12(2), 551-572. [[pdf](http://www.ocean-sci-discuss.net/12/551/2015/osd-12-551-2015.pdf)]

They calculate trends sea level trends at two gages with publicly available data (Vaca and Virginia Key). My calculated trend at Vaca Key was very similar to Park and Sweet (**2015**). However, my calculated trend at Virginia Key was quite a bit higher despite using the same period-of-record. One explanation for the different trend numbers might be that they were using provisional data that has since been corrected.

|Station      | Trend (mm yr-1)| Uncertainty (se)|
|:------------|---------------:|----------------:|
|Vaca Key     |            3.91|             0.43|
|Virginia Key |            4.66|             0.92|
