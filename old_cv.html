Research:
Statement of Research Interests: It is my general research philosophy to conduct nationally relevant research and
apply the results of that research to locally important issues. Both levels of research serve to inform
environmental policy and improve the environment, which is the ultimate goal of applied environmental research.
Towards that end, I hope to contribute to research in landscape ecology, geospatial technologies (e.g. geographic
information systems, spatial statistics, and remote sensing), ecoinformatics/reproducible research/data science,
and broad scale environmental monitoring and modeling. Specifically, I wish to continue my past work and use
broad scale monitoring data (e.g. Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program data (EMAP), National
Land Cover Dataset (NLCD)) to explore the links between landscape structure (e.g. landscape composition and
configuration) and the ecological health and integrity of receiving waters. Furthermore, I am keenly interested in
applying cutting edge informatics and data science tools (e.g. semantic web, analytics, “Big Data”, eScience, etc.)
to environmental research conducted by the US EPA.
Research and Professional Experience:
Aug 2008 - Present Research Ecologist, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Atlantic Ecology Division,
Narragansett, RI
I serve as principle investigator and provide leadership to the division on landscape
ecological research, on application of geospatial sciences to the understanding of water
quality in fresh and estuarine waters, and on the use of informatics and information
management tools in environmental research. In this role, I have developed tools and
methodologies (GIS and statistical) using numerous software packages and languages (R,
ArcGIS, GRASS, Python, MS Excel) and have continued prior research on technology
transfer of data, analytical methods and predictive tools to Northeast States; and
developed statistical and modeling tools to facilitate use of defensible techniques in water
quality criteria development. Previously I have: served as Co-lead on a project studying
ecosystem services related to nutrient cycling in Northeastern lakes and ponds, was the
liaison between the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and EPA’s
Ecosystem Services Research Program (ESRP), was task lead for our lakes ecosystem
services work, and served as co-task lead for developing decision support tools for a
project in Narragansett Bay and its watershed. I am currently serving as a co-Task Lead
on a project exploring cyanobacterial risk in lakes of the Northeastern US. I am also
exploring the use of data science, Big Data, informatics, and related technologies in our
various research programs. These data efforts include course work, a linked open data
project, and involvement with various outside organizations such as the ESIP Federation
and Data.gov
May 2006 – July 2008 Postdoctoral Landscape Ecologist, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Atlantic
Ecology Division, Narragansett, RI
Contributed to research and technology transfer of National Coastal Assessment data,
analytical methods and predictive tools to Northeast States. Developed statistical and
modeling tools (e.g. Conditional Probability Analysis with R and Excel) to facilitate use
of defensible techniques in water quality criteria development. Provided Landscape
Ecology, Spatial Statistics and GIS support to a variety of ongoing projects at the Atlantic
Ecology Division and within US EPA’s Office of Research and Development. Explored
linkages between landscape and downstream receiving waters and examined utility of
broad scale monitoring data in identifying and assessing ecological impairment.
Aug 2005 – May 2006 Postdoctoral Fellow, U.S. Coast Guard Academy, Dep. of Science, Marine Sciences
Section, New London, CT
Continued prior research on multi-scale interactions between landscape structure (via
NLCD) and sediment metal concentrations (via EMAP) and predictive modeling of
estuarine impairment. Worked with students, faculty and colleagues in the Marine
Sciences Section, the International Ice Patrol, and Information Services Division on a
wide variety of Geographic Information Systems projects.
Jan 2005 – July 2005 Postdoctoral Associate, American Institute of Biological Sciences, National Ecological
Observatory (NEON) Project Office, Washington, DC
Researched and assisted in planning of ecological observatories designed to address the
National Research Council’s Environmental Grand Challenges. Made specific
contributions in the design of the land use change component of NEON and design of a
Multi-Scaled Remote Sensing System designed to support and develop NEON analytical
tools and ecological forecasting models. Other duties included managing Geographic
Information Systems operations in the Project Office, maintaining the NEON web
presence (http://www.neoninc.org), interacting with research scientists and educators on
the NEON Senior Management Team and National Network Design Committee, and
assisting with the day-to-day operations of the NEON Project Office.
Sep 2000 – Dec 2004 U.S. EPA/URI Pre-doctoral Fellow/Doctoral Research/Graduate Research Assistant,
USEPA Atlantic Ecology Division/University of Rhode Island Northeast Environmental
Research Training Program, Narragansett, RI/Kingston, RI
Used monitoring data from the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program
(EMAP) and the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) to explore relationships between
landscape structure and indicators of estuarine condition. I specifically researched the
accuracy of the NLCD at multiple spatial scales, the role of spatial scale on the
relationship between landscape organization (e.g. landscape composition) and ecological
health and integrity of Atlantic coast estuaries, and built predictive models of estuarine
condition designed to locate estuaries with impacted ecological integrity. As member of
Landscape Ecology Working Group, discussed and assisted on projects at USEPA
Atlantic Ecology Division and URI utilizing landscape ecology, spatial analysis and
broad scale environmental monitoring data, in particular NLCD and EMAP.
May 2003 – Aug 2004 Geographic Information Systems/Biological Database Specialist, Rhode Island Natural
History Survey, Kingston, RI
Contributed towards the design and implementation of the Rhode Island Natural History
Survey (RINHS) Biodiversity Databases, specifically the Odonata of Rhode Island and
the Biota of Rhode Island. Designed field sampling methodology to accurately map
invasive species with geostatistical techniques.
Jan 2001 – June 2001 Geographic Information System/Eelgrass Restoration Modeling Consultant, Save the
Bay, Inc., Kingston, RI
Compiled bathymetry, current and historic eelgrass locations, historic, and water quality
data sets for use in eelgrass restoration efforts. Using the Short et al. (2002)
methodology, built geographic information system models of eelgrass restoration
potential and generated maps of areas in Narragansett Bay with higher potential of
eelgrass restoration success.
June 1998 – July 2000 Lead Research Technician in Landscape Ecology, J.W. Jones Ecological Research
Center, Landscape Ecology Lab, Newton, GA
Conducted research on ecological impacts of small wetland loss in the Southeastern
United States, use of home range in the design of gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus)
reserves, and habitat use and landscape ecology of Northern Bobwhite Quail . Other
research duties included remote sensing data analysis (e.g. Landsat Thematic Mapper,
SPOT-XS, B&W and CIR Aerial Photography), analysis of vector and raster GIS data,
and field data collection (e.g. GPS, vegetation data). Supervised and assisted other
technicians, graduate students and summer field workers and managed day-to-day
operations of the Landscape Ecology Lab.
Aug 1997 – Jan 1998 Geographic Information Systems Specialist, Research Triangle Institute, Research
Triangle Park, NC
Developed a GIS methodology and series of Arc Macro Language scripts to facilitate the
identification of river reaches, as required by the Clean Water Act, in the states of North
Dakota and Arkansas.
